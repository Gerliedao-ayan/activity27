## CSS Grid: A Powerful Layout System

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that revolutionizes web design by providing a flexible and powerful way to arrange content. It's like a real-world grid, with rows and columns that you can use to precisely position elements on your web page.

Key Concepts:


Grid Container: The element that defines the grid. It's usually a parent element containing the grid items. You make an element a grid container by setting its display property to grid.

Grid Items: The direct children of the grid container. These are the elements that will be placed within the grid.

Grid Lines: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (column grid lines) or horizontal (row grid lines).

Grid Tracks: The space between two adjacent grid lines. These are essentially the columns or rows of the grid.

Grid Areas: The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells.

Grid Cells: The individual units formed by the intersection of rows and columns.
